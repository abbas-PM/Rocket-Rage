# Background
Rocket Rage is a 2D game where you control and guide a rocket through endless walls. Your goal is 
to avoid these walls and survive as long as you can. With every wall you avoid, you gain an energy point, which
can be used for a powerup. You can pool your scores from each game to buy unique skins.
